Feature: CAMARA QoS Profiles API, v0.11.1 - Operation retrieveQoSProfiles
    # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
    #
    # Implementation indications:
    # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
    # * List of device identifier types which are not supported, among: phoneNumber, ipv4Address, ipv6Address.
    #   For this version, CAMARA does not allow the use of networkAccessIdentifier, so it is considered by default as not supported.
    #
    # Testing assets:
    # * The name of an existing QoS profile
    # * If some QoS Profile is restricted for some devices, provide the QoS profile name and device
    # * A device object identifying a device commercialized by the implementation for which the service is not applicable, if any

    # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specifies in qos-profiles.yaml, version 0.11.0

    Background: Common retrieveQoSProfiles setup
        Given an environment at "apiRoot"
        And the resource "qos-profiles/v0.11/retrieve-qos-profiles"
        And the header "Content-Type" is set to "application/json"
        And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
        And the header "x-correlator" is set to a UUID value
        # Properties not explicitly overwitten in the Scenarios can take any values compliant with the schema
        And the request body is set by default to a request body compliant with the schema at "/components/schemas/QosProfileDeviceRequest"
