Feature: CAMARA QoD Provisioning API, v0.1.1 - Operation retrieveProvisioningByDevice
    # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
    #
    # Implementation indications:
    # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
    # * List of device identifier types which are not supported, among: phoneNumber, ipv4Address, ipv6Address.
    #   For this version, CAMARA does not allow the use of networkAccessIdentifier, so it is considered by default as not supported.
    #
    # Testing assets:
    # * A device object with an existing QoD provisioning associated, and the request properties used for createProvisioning
    # * A device object with NO existing QoD provisioning associated
    # * A device object identifying a device commercialized by the implementation for which the service is not applicable, if any
    #
    # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in qod-provisioning.yaml, version 0.1.0
